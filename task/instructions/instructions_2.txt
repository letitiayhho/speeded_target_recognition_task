You will first be shown a target vowel on the screen, and
then played a series of vowels.
When you hear the target vowel press the "m" key. 
An "x" symbol will appear while each vowel is playing
to indicate when you may submit a response.
You will need to listen carefully to each vowel as they
will be presented quickly.
